# Gulp

Find all our gulp tasks in this folder. While the `index.js` only defines the task sequence, the tasks are placed in the `tasks` sub folder to provide for a clean gulp environment.

Also thereâ€™s a shared `config.js` containing all relevant gulp configuration.

## Usage

Run your frontend workflow (based on `.env` settings) by:

    $ gulp
    
## Development

Watch out for inline comments providing a lot of information on the tasks!
